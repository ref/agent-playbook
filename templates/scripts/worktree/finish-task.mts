/**
 * Retire a task started by `task:start`.
 *
 *   <pkg-manager> run task:finish -- <name>     # from the main checkout / another workspace
 *   <pkg-manager> run task:finish -- --here     # from inside the task's own worktree
 *
 * Two steps, and their ORDER is the whole design:
 *
 *   1. `worktree:teardown` removes the worktree and judges its branch. If
 *      it refuses — a dirty tree — this script stops and the workspace
 *      stays open, because that workspace is where the uncommitted work is.
 *   2. `cmux workspace close` LAST. Closing a workspace kills its process
 *      tree, so anything after it is code that may never run.
 *
 * The same fact makes running this from INSIDE the workspace being closed a
 * way to kill the script mid-flight. Two guards refuse that before anything
 * happens: cwd inside the target worktree, and — better, because it survives
 * a `cd` — the caller's own workspace being the target one, which cmux will
 * tell us.
 *
 * `--here` is the one legal way THROUGH those guards, not around them: run
 * with no name from inside the task's worktree, it derives the name from the
 * directory (`taskNameFromWorktreePath`) and re-executes this same script
 * DETACHED — its own session via `spawn(..., { detached: true })`, cwd moved
 * to the main checkout, the `CMUX_*` identity variables cleared so `cmux
 * identify` no longer names the doomed workspace as the caller. The detached
 * child then passes both guards on their own terms and survives the
 * workspace's process tree being killed. Its output goes to a log beside the
 * repo's other machine logs (`.git/task-finish-<name>.log`), and because
 * nobody is watching that log, every OUTCOME is also announced as a desktop
 * notification (`--announce`, the internal flag the re-exec adds): retired,
 * refused-dirty, or could-not-close. A refusal that only a log file saw
 * would be indistinguishable from the feature not existing.
 *
 * The workspace is found by TITLE first and by CURRENT DIRECTORY second
 * (`resolveTaskWorkspace`): titles are human-readable and get renamed,
 * cwds do not — a renamed workspace used to mean the teardown ran but the
 * workspace stayed open, looking half-done.
 *
 * cmux is OPTIONAL here too: no cmux means the teardown still runs and the
 * script still succeeds — `--here` included, there is just no workspace to
 * close and no notification channel, only the log.
 *
 * Imports nothing but node builtins and the pure modules beside it.
