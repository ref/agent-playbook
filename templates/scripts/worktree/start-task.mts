/**
 * Start a task in one command: worktree, provisioned, in its own workspace.
 *
 *   <pkg-manager> run task:start -- <name> <branch>
 *
 * Three steps that were four manual ones (`git worktree add`, `cd`,
 * `worktree:setup`, then set up a terminal by hand). Four steps repeated
 * every single time is the friction that stops parallel work from starting
 * at all, which is the point of this script.
 *
 * It composes, never duplicates: the worktree provisioning is
 * `worktree:setup` (allowlisted `.env` + install), invoked as a child
 * process inside the new worktree. Its counterpart is `task:finish`.
 *
 * cmux is OPTIONAL. Without it — not installed, or its socket unreachable —
 * the worktree and its setup still happen, the script says the workspace was
 * not created, and it exits 0. A machine without cmux still gets the useful
 * two thirds.
 *
 * Imports nothing but node builtins and the pure module beside it.
