# RUNBOOK — the human's page

<!-- Customize: nothing in this preamble — it is what makes agents keep the page current. -->

Everything YOU run, click, or must remember to operate this project day to day. Agents keep
this file current: any PR that adds something human-facing (a script, a page, an env var, a
ritual) must update it — the PR template's Docs section and the reviewer's docs-honesty item
enforce that. If you catch yourself remembering something this page doesn't say, that's a bug
in this page — file it.

## Daily development

<!-- Customize: add the commands you actually type; delete the lines that don't apply. -->

- **Starting a task**: type `/do <n>` in the agent session — that replaces the whole
  typed preamble. It reads `AGENTS.md` and issue #n **including its comments** (spec
  amendments live there), then decides what the issue needs next: a substantial issue with
  no spec turns the session into a brainstorm that writes the spec and the plan (`AGENTS.md`
  "Specs and plans") and stops; otherwise it gets onto the right branch, implements, and
  ships the PR. Filing a two-line reminder issue is fine — `/do` grows it when its turn
  comes. `/ship` on its own re-runs just the tail — rebase, gate, push, PR — on a branch
  whose work is already done and committed.
- **Keeping the playbook current**: `/playbook-update` syncs this repo against the
  playbook (it answers "up to date" in seconds when nothing moved); `/playbook-compact`,
  run occasionally, shrinks the accumulated memory files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, this
  page) without losing rules — both show their report before writing, both land as a
  normal PR you merge.
- **Where the skills live**: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, in this
  repo. They are ordinary files — edit them when a rule of yours changes, same as any doc.
  `.claude/skills/*` are symlinks to them, because Claude Code doesn't read `.agents/`. Every
  other agent tool reads `.agents/` directly, which is the point: the reviewer is supposed to
  be a different model family than the author, so the protocol can't live in one vendor's
  plugin.
- **Checking the wiring still holds**: ask any agent session to run the "Verify the
  installation" checklist at the end of `ADOPT.md` in the playbook repository. It re-verifies
  what adoption set up — the skill symlinks resolve, no placeholder survived, `core.hooksPath`
  points at `.githooks`, the hook actually refuses a push to the default branch, merges are
  squash-only. Worth a run after every fresh clone and every new worktree: `core.hooksPath` is
  a per-clone setting that is never committed, so a new clone starts with the pre-push lock
  disarmed and nothing says so.
- **Dev servers**: only you start/stop them. Agents never do — if a server is behaving oddly,
  restart it yourself after a merge.
- **When a verdict lands** _(cmux; delete this line if this machine has none)_: the
  auto-review launcher announces it by itself — a desktop notification
  (`Review #<pr>` / `VERDICT: …`); on an approve the PR page opens as a background
  tab in the reviewer's workspace, already waiting when you switch over; on a blocker
  the author's task workspace flips to the `needs-attention` sidebar lane, gets a
  checklist item, and its live session receives the fix instruction as a user message.
  Automatic, best-effort, nothing to configure; no cmux → no announcements, everything
  else unchanged. Two more events notify, and only these two: **the reviewer is waiting
  on a prompt** (its terminal has not moved for three minutes) and **the review ended
  without a verdict**. A review that merely started, queued or took the lock says
  nothing — it needs nothing from you. If you ever wire more notifications, wire them to EVENTS (a verdict landed),
  never to every tool call: a notify per "ask" against a broad allowlist announces
  prompts that never come — once per command, for the whole review. Per-ask announcements
  pair only with a NARROW allowlist: both or neither.
- **The local gate** (what CI will run anyway):

      {{PKG_MANAGER}} run format:check && {{PKG_MANAGER}} run type-check && {{PKG_MANAGER}} run lint && {{PKG_MANAGER}} run knip && {{TEST_CMD}}{{RUST_GATE}}

## The dashboard and the question page

<!-- Customize: delete this section if you declined the dashboard module at adoption. -->

- **Where are we**: `/dashboard` in any agent session (or `.agents/dashboard.sh start`
  in a terminal) opens the repository dashboard — feature branches against their
  umbrella issues, PRs by stage (ready to merge, blocker, CI failed, CI running,
  awaiting review, draft), open issues, the task worktrees with their pills, the latest
  merges — in its own cmux workspace `dashboard · <repo>` right after yours. It
  refreshes itself every minute, and at once after `/ship`, a review verdict and
  `task:finish`. One per repository, wherever you start it from.
- **Closing it**: `.agents/dashboard.sh stop`, or close the `dashboard · <repo>`
  workspace — the loop notices on its next tick and ends. Its files live in the main
  checkout's `.git/`: `dashboard.html`, `dashboard.log`, `dashboard.lock`,
  `dashboard.surface`, `dashboard.workspace`.
- **The same answer in a terminal**: `.agents/dashboard.sh json` — what the dashboard
  shows, as JSON; it works without cmux, and it is what an agent reads when you ask
  "where are we" in the chat.
- **A question on a page**: when an agent has a choice to put to you — approaches,
  shapes, a recommendation to confirm — it may open it as a page in a split beside its
  terminal: numbered options, a free-text note, `⌘↵` to send. Close the tab to answer in
  the chat instead; the agent asks again there. The reviewer never does this.

## Features that take several PRs (feature branches)

<!-- Customize: nothing — the rules are in AGENTS.md "Feature branches"; this is what YOU do. -->

A feature whose pieces are useless until the last one lands does not reach users piece
by piece: it grows on `feature/<topic>` and reaches the trunk — and so the deploy — in
ONE PR, after you have tried it. Small issues with no umbrella go straight to the trunk
as always. Your part, start to finish:

- **Starting one**: file the issue, `/do <n>` as usual. The spec+plan session asks you
  whether the phases land on a feature branch (the default) or one by one; on a feature
  branch it creates `feature/<topic>` and writes `Branch: feature/<topic>` into the
  umbrella issue. Every `/do <sub-issue>` reads that line and opens its PR into the
  feature branch — you merge those PRs exactly as you merge any other (squash, green CI
  on the latest commit, the verdict comment). Nothing deploys. The sub-issue closes and
  its line in the umbrella ticks itself on merge (`feature-merge.yml`).
- **Working on something else meanwhile**: nothing to do. A fix or a small feature is a
  normal issue, a normal PR into the trunk, a normal deploy; the feature branch does not
  see it until an agent merges the trunk into it, which happens on its own at the next
  sub-task and before the feature PR.
- **Pausing**: stop starting its sub-issues. The branch waits. Resuming is the next
  `/do <sub-issue>`; the agent merges the trunk in first, and the longer the pause the
  more that merge may ask you about.
- **Trying it**: when the umbrella's checklist is fully ticked, in your own checkout —
  `git switch feature/<topic>`, the usual migrate/dev commands, click through. A bug is
  a new issue carrying `Refs #<umbrella>`; `/do` sends its PR into the feature branch.
  Switch back to the trunk when done — an agent that finds the feature branch checked
  out here will stop and ask instead of pushing to it.
- **Releasing it**: in that checkout, on the feature branch, tell an agent `/ship`. It
  merges the trunk in, runs the gate, opens `feature/<topic>` → trunk with
  `Closes #<umbrella>`, and the reviewer runs an integration review (the pieces were
  reviewed on the way in). Merge it like any PR — squash — and the deploy carries the
  whole feature at once. GitHub deletes the branch; a second wave of the same topic is
  a new issue and a new branch.
- **Schema changes never ride the feature branch**: the plan puts each one in its own
  small PR into the trunk, additive only, so your dev database stays valid for the
  trunk and the feature at once. `/ship` refuses a schema diff aimed at a feature
  branch; that refusal is the rule working, not a bug.

## Worktrees (parallel tasks)

<!-- Customize: if you declined the worktree module at adoption, delete this section
     EXCEPT the reviewer-worktree line and the status-pill entry — the pill is not part
     of the module (it reports any cmux workspace of this repo), and without the module
     nothing can retire the reviewer directory for you; a deleted section is how both
     go unnoticed. -->


- **Start a task in its own worktree**: `{{PKG_MANAGER}} run task:start -- <name> <branch>
  [prompt]` — cuts `<branch>` from the latest default branch into `../<repo>-wt-<name>`,
  provisions it (filtered `.env` + install), and opens a workspace running the agent beside
  yours where cmux is running (`cmux new-split right` adds a shell pane if you want one).
  `--base feature/<topic>` before the name cuts it from that feature branch instead
  (`/do` passes it itself when it spawns a sub-task; you only need it when you start one
  by hand).
  Everything after the branch is the agent's FIRST TURN (`… fix/links "/do 46"`) — pass it
  whenever the task is already known: a workspace opened without it is an agent waiting
  for input nobody is going to type. Without cmux the worktree is still ready but the
  prompt was NOT delivered; the script prints the launch command to run after `cd`.
- **What a task workspace's pill says** _(cmux; delete this entry if this machine has none)_:
  five states, and **amber means the agent literally cannot proceed without you** — never
  just "it went quiet". That distinction is the whole design; the rest follows from it.

  | Pill | What it means | Lane |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 🔨 `Working` | The agent is moving. Past a minute it reads `Working 5m` | left alone |
  | 🔔 `Waiting for you` | A permission prompt, an options dialog, or a plan waiting for approval | `needs-attention` |
  | 🔔 `Asked you a question` | The turn ended on a question in prose | `needs-attention` |
  | ⚙️ `Background work` | The turn ended, you are not needed, but a background task is still running | left alone |
  | ✅ `Finished` | The turn ended and nothing is needed | left alone |

  Written by `.agents/task-status.sh` (with `.agents/task-status-stop.mjs` for the turn-end
  cases), wired as Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json` — under its own `task` key,
  so it sits beside cmux's own `claude_code` pill instead of fighting it, and below the
  `review` pill `auto-review.sh` writes. Nothing to configure; outside cmux it does nothing
  at all. It exists because cmux's Claude wrapper clears `claude_code` when you answer a
  permission prompt without writing `Running` back, so a working task workspace used to go
  blank for the rest of the run.
  **Known limit: a hard kill leaves the pill behind.** A crash, `kill -9`, or quitting
  cmux skips the `SessionEnd` hook, so a dead workspace can keep claiming `Working`.
  Closing the workspace removes it — nothing else will.
  **Known limit: the elapsed time stands still inside a long tool call.** The pill only
  updates when a hook fires, so a 10-minute `docker build` is one event, not six hundred:
  `Working 2m` can sit unchanged for the whole build and then jump. The number is a floor
  on how long the turn has run, not a live clock.
  **Known limit: the question pill is a guess, and a deliberately crude one.** It fires on
  a trailing `?` on the agent's last line, so "Which one? Let me know." reads as finished
  and a report that closes on a rhetorical question reads as a question. Wrong colour,
  nothing worse. The three `Waiting for you` triggers are machine facts and do not guess.
- **Retire it when the PR lands**: `{{PKG_MANAGER}} run task:finish -- <name>` — removes
  the worktree, deletes the branch ONLY when that provably loses nothing (merged PR
  containing the tip, or everything pushed), closes the workspace last. A refusal means
  uncommitted work is in there — that refusal is the safety net, don't force it.
- **Or finish from INSIDE the task**: `{{PKG_MANAGER}} run task:finish -- --here`, typed
  in the task's own workspace (no name needed — the worktree names the task). It detaches
  itself, runs the same teardown, and closes the very workspace you typed it in; the
  outcome arrives as a desktop notification, and the record lands in
  `.git/task-finish-<name>.log`. If the repo carries `.cmux/cmux.json`, the same command
  is the **Finish task** entry in cmux's ⌘⇧P palette (first run asks a one-time trust
  question — that is cmux's own model for project-local actions). A refusal (uncommitted
  work) leaves the workspace open and says so in the notification.
- **Forgot to finish? Nothing to do.** `{{PKG_MANAGER}} run worktree:gc` compares the
  worktrees on disk with the workspaces open in cmux and retires every task that has no
  open workspace AND is provably DONE — merged PR containing the branch tip, clean tree.
  Anything less than proof is left untouched, so closing a workspace mid-review stays a
  free gesture, and a merged task with uncommitted leftovers announces itself instead of
  being cleaned. `task:start` runs a gc in its preamble, so starting the next task sweeps
  up after the finished ones — there is no daemon to keep running, and closes that happen
  with cmux quit entirely are caught the same way, because gc reads current state, not
  events.
- **Tidy up leftovers**: `{{PKG_MANAGER}} run worktree:teardown -- --sweep` — reports
  stale registrations, stray directories and orphaned branches; prints deletion commands
  but never deletes a branch itself.
- **The reviewer's worktree** — `../<repo>-wt-review`, one per repository, created on the
  first auto-review and kept (that is what makes the folder-trust prompt a one-time
  question). It holds a detached checkout plus `node_modules`; the full provisioning runs
  once, and every later review re-runs only the frozen install, so a PR that adds a
  dependency is reviewed with it installed. Nothing retires it on a schedule: remove it
  when you want the disk back or a review is stuck on a bad tree — `{{PKG_MANAGER}} run worktree:teardown --
  --disposable ../<repo>-wt-review`, or without this module
  `git worktree remove --force ../<repo>-wt-review` then `git worktree prune`. The next
  `/ship` recreates it. Directories named
  `<repo>-wt-review-<number>` are from the older per-PR scheme; the launcher retires them
  where the worktree module is installed and tells you about them where it isn't.
- **What worktrees may see**: the `.env` allowlist in `scripts/worktree-utils.mts` —
  ships empty; every key you add becomes visible to every worktree, including a
  reviewer's. Secrets stay out.

## Database

<!-- Customize: DELETE this section if the project has no database. -->

- One shared dev DB; the one-schema-branch-at-a-time rule and who may apply it live in
  `AGENTS.md` — that section is the law, this is the recap.
- <!-- Customize: keep this line only where ADOPT.md's schema-lock check is installed. -->
  A red `check:schema-lock` means another in-flight branch holds the schema. Your
  override: `ALLOW_SCHEMA_CONFLICT=1 {{PKG_MANAGER}} run check:schema-lock` — whoever
  lands second owns reconciling the schema by hand, forward only. Agents never use it;
  they ask you who goes first.
- Rebuild the dev DB from schema when it's wedged: _(add the command)_ — destructive to dev
  data, which is disposable by design.
- After a schema PR merges: rebuild the dev DB from the default branch before the next schema
  task starts.

## Dependency cooldowns (supply chain)

<!-- Customize: add the local half (your package manager's minimum-release-age setting) once you enable it. -->

Nothing may enter this repo until its release has been public for a few days. Nearly every
malicious npm release is caught and pulled within 24–72h, so the wait skips that window.
The policy is **3 days for minor/patch, 14 days for majors**, and it belongs in two places
because neither half can do the other's job:

| Layer                     | Where                    | What it gates                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Dependabot `cooldown:`    | `.github/dependabot.yml` | when a bump PR is even **opened** (server-side) |
| Package-manager min-age   | your package manager     | what **any local install** may resolve to       |

- **Security updates bypass the Dependabot cooldown by design** — a known-exploited CVE
  outranks a fresh-release risk. Confirm they're on: repo **Settings → Advanced Security →
  Dependabot security updates**. Only you can see or toggle that checkbox; no PR can.
- A local min-age setting gates the **lockfile too, not just fresh resolution**: pnpm
  verifies lockfile entries on every install, `--frozen-lockfile` included, so CI goes red
  while ANY entry — a transitive somebody's bump dragged in included — is younger than the
  cutoff. That red is the quarantine working: wait the window out, or use the exclude
  below. Never `trustLockfile: true` — it "fixes" this by turning off the supply-chain
  verification pass itself, the protection the cooldown exists to add.
- If you need a package published today, add that exact version to your package manager's
  exclude list, install, then drop the line in the same PR — with a comment naming the CVE.
  An exclude with no removal date in its comment is a bug.

## CI shape (what runs, and what it bills)

<!-- Customize: the timings and the job list, once you've watched a few real runs. -->

- Three workflows, one job each: **CI** (`checks` — type-check, lint, build, tests), **PR
  hygiene** (body + title greps) and **Security** (gitleaks). Build is a STEP inside `checks`,
  not a job of its own: GitHub bills per job rounded up to the minute, so a second runner
  costs ~2 billed minutes for ~40s of work.
- **One more runs AFTER a merge, not before**: **Feature merge** closes the sub-issues a
  PR into a feature branch names (GitHub only does that on a trunk merge) and ticks their
  lines in the umbrella. Seconds of work, never a required check — there is nothing left
  to block once the PR has merged.
- **A doc-only PR runs no real CI, on purpose.** `ci.yml` ignores `docs/**`, `**.md`
  (anywhere, root included) and the agent-config directories; `ci-docs.yml` — its no-op
  twin — reports the green `checks` for exactly those PRs, so a required status check
  never hangs on them. Expected and mergeable.
- **Security runs on PRs only**, not on default-branch pushes: a squash commit is built from
  commits gitleaks already scanned, and direct pushes are blocked by the pre-push hook.
- Every job carries `timeout-minutes`. GitHub's default is 360 — one hung test would burn a
  large slice of a monthly quota in a single incident.
{{RUST_RUNBOOK_BLOCK}}

## Merging (your ritual)

<!-- Customize: nothing — these two rules ARE the branch protection until you buy the real thing. -->

- You are the only merger; squash only — into the trunk and into a feature branch alike.
  The two hard rules (never merge while "Update branch" is visible; never merge without
  green CI on the PR's LATEST commit) are in `AGENTS.md` "Getting to master"; a feature
  PR adds a third: never before you have tried the feature branch yourself.
- Independent review before merging substantive PRs: a FRESH agent session runs
  `/review <n>` — cross-family review is deliberate. Wait for `VERDICT: approve`,
  **posted as a comment on the PR**. A reviewer that reports a verdict only in its own chat
  window has left you nothing to merge against; if that happens, ask it to post the comment
  before you merge.
- Where `.agents/auto-review.sh` is installed, `/ship` starts that reviewer for you — on
  the PR's creation and on every fix push — so your part is only reading the verdict
  comments. A **blocker** verdict additionally reaches the author's own task workspace on
  three channels: the workspace flips to the `needs-attention` sidebar lane and gets a
  checklist item ("PR #N: fix review blockers, then /ship") — both of which survive a
  closed session — and a live session there receives "fix the blockers, then /ship" as a
  user message, so expect it to start working on the fixes before you have read anything.
  An **approve** messages nobody, since what follows it (your hand-test, your merge) is
  yours. Expect ONE question EVER, not one per PR: the very first review in this
  repository opens with a folder-trust prompt in its `review #<pr>` workspace, because
  the reviewer CLI trusts directories and all reviews share one worktree. Answer it once
  and every later review runs unattended. **A prompt on the second PR is a
  misconfiguration to fix, not a habit to acquire** — the permission allowlist, the
  file grants or the launch flags; the reviewer's page (`templates/agy/README.md` for
  agy) says which. Reviews also serialise, since they share that worktree: a second PR's
  workspace opens straight away and waits, with `auto-review` reading "queued behind #N".
  The same state machine is mirrored into the **cmux sidebar**, which is the surface
  you are actually looking at while you work _(delete this paragraph if this machine has
  no cmux)_. The `review #<pr>` workspace carries a pill for wherever the review has got
  to — 🕘 `Queued behind #M`, ⚙️ `Preparing…`, 👁 `Reviewing · PR #N`, 🔔 `Waiting for
  you`, ✅ `Approved`, ⛔️ `Blocker — see the comment`, ❌ `Failed — run /review N` — and
  the two that need you (`Waiting for you`, `Failed`) also put it in the
  `needs-attention` lane and fire a notification. **`Waiting for you` is the one to act
  on**: it means the reviewer's terminal has not changed for three minutes, which from
  outside is what an unanswered permission prompt looks like. Switch to that workspace and
  answer it; the pill goes back to `Reviewing` on its own once the screen moves again.
  An approved review **stays open** behind its green pill — nothing auto-closes it, so
  the transcript is still there to read, and closing it is your call.
  Meanwhile your own task workspace stops saying "Needs input" about a minute after
  `/ship` — the work is done and under review, not waiting on you — and says
  👁 `In review · PR #N` instead, then ✅ `Approved · PR #N — merge when ready` or
  ⛔️ `Blocker · PR #N` when the verdict lands. That swap happens once per `/ship`: if you
  resume the session yourself, its normal "Needs input" comes back and stays.
  The launcher also reports its lifecycle as an **`auto-review` status** in the PR's
  checks list: pending = reviewer running right now, green = verdict comment posted,
  red = the review ended without one (the log below says why). Past an hour with no
  verdict, pending starts naming the age — "no verdict after 90 min — the reviewer's
  screen is still moving; it is working, not stuck" — because a bare `pending` gets read
  as "nearly done". It says the opposite ("the reviewer is waiting on you") when the
  stall watch above has caught it, and falls back to the old "may be waiting on a prompt"
  hedge only where it could not read the terminal at all. Past twelve hours it goes red
  as abandoned. A green `auto-review` is
  NOT an approval — it only means the verdict landed; the verdict itself can be a blocker.
  Run `/review <n>` by hand when the auto-run never landed a comment, or when you want a
  second opinion from a different tool.
- The comment's first line is `Reviewed-by: <tool / model family>, head <sha>`, and it is
  the only part you have to read. Two things must be true in it: the family is not the
  author's, and the sha is the PR's latest commit. Either one wrong means the approval on
  screen is not the approval you think you have.

## Emergency overrides (yours alone — agents may never use them)

<!-- Customize: nothing. If an agent ever uses one of these, that is an AGENTS.md "Never" entry. -->

- `ALLOW_DIRECT_PUSH=1 git push …` — direct push to the default branch, past the pre-push hook.
  This clears the LOCAL hook only. If the branch ruleset (the playbook's SETUP.md §2)
  is configured, GitHub still refuses the push — temporarily switch the ruleset to
  Disabled (Settings → Rules → Rulesets, or
  `gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/<id> -f enforcement=disabled`), push,
  then switch it back to Active IMMEDIATELY: while it is disabled, nothing protects
  the branch.
- `SKIP_PUSH_GATE=1 git push …` — skip the local static gate.

## When something looks broken

<!-- Customize: add a row every time you had to figure something out twice. -->

| Symptom                        | First move                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A doc-only PR's `checks` is instant | That's `ci-docs.yml`, the no-op twin — `ci.yml` skips `docs/**` and `**.md` by design |
| CI red on `gitleaks`           | Treat as a real leak until proven otherwise; if real: rotate the credential FIRST     |
| CI red on the build step       | The author fixes it, never you — it fails before the test step, so it fails cheap     |
| PR hygiene red                 | The body is missing its issue link or its `## Docs` answer — the author writes both   |
| A merged sub-PR left its issue open or its umbrella line unticked | Open the **Feature merge** run on that PR (Actions tab): the body had no `Closes #N`, or the umbrella line is not in the `- [ ] #N` form. Fix the line by hand this once; the next sub-PR's author fixes the habit |
| `/ship` refused a sub-task for touching the schema | By design: a schema change goes to the trunk as its own small PR, then the task rebases onto it — `AGENTS.md` "Specs and plans" |
| The dashboard stopped updating | `.agents/dashboard.sh stop`, then `start`; the loop's log is `.git/dashboard.log`. A `start` that says "already open" for a tab that is gone: remove `.git/dashboard.lock` and `.git/dashboard.surface`, then `start` again. A banner "Partial data" names the source that failed (usually `gh` offline or rate-limited) — the rest is still current |
| An agent's question page never appeared | Outside cmux, or from the reviewer, the script refuses and the agent asks in the chat — that is the design. Inside cmux: the agent's command timeout was shorter than the page's (`--timeout`, 540 s by default); the agent lowers one or raises the other |
| No verdict comment after `/ship` | Look at the `review #<pr>` workspace's pill first — `Waiting for you` means answer the prompt there, `Failed` means run `/review <n>` yourself. The PR's `auto-review` status says the same: pending = still running (past an hour it names the age and whether the terminal is still moving); red = ended without posting; missing = never launched. Detail: `.git/auto-review-<pr>.log` in the author's working copy |
| A shipped workspace still says "Needs input" | The pill swap needs about a minute, and it happens once per `/ship` — if you typed into that session after shipping, its real "Needs input" is back and correct. A workspace that never swaps means the launcher could not match it to the PR's branch; `.git/auto-review-<pr>.log` says "author workspace: unresolved" |
