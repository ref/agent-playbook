description: Take a finished task branch in this repo to a pull request — rebase onto its base, full local gate, push, open the PR against the default branch or the feature branch the task belongs to; on a feature branch, ship the whole feature to the default branch. Use when asked to ship, push, or open a PR for the current branch, whichever tool you are.
---

You are shipping the current branch: bring it up to date with its base, run the gate,
push, open the PR. Run this when the work is done and committed.

**`AGENTS.md` "Getting to master" in THIS repo is canonical** — it defines this ritual and
this file executes it. Where the two disagree, AGENTS.md wins and this file is the bug. Work
the steps in order; a red step stops the ship, it never gets skipped.

Detect the default branch rather than assuming its name:

    DEFAULT=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name)

Then resolve the BASE this branch's PR targets — the trunk is not a safe default, a
sub-task shipped there deploys half a feature (AGENTS.md "Feature branches"):

- **The current branch is `feature/<topic>`** → this is a FEATURE SHIP: `BASE=$DEFAULT`,
  and steps 2 and 5 take their feature-ship form below.
- **A PR already exists for this branch** → `BASE=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q
  .baseRefName)`; the base was decided when it was opened.
- **Otherwise** → the issue this branch closes decides, exactly as the `do` skill's step 2
  resolves it: the issue's umbrella (`Refs #<umbrella>`) carries `Branch: feature/<topic>`
  on its own line → that branch; the issue says it ships to the trunk, or there is no
  such line → `$DEFAULT`. Unsure which issue → ask, never guess the trunk.

## 1. Refuse to ship the wrong thing

    git status -sb

- **On the default branch** → STOP. Agents never push to it (AGENTS.md "Never"). Get on a
  task branch first — the `do` skill does that.
- **Dirty tree** → STOP. Commit the work first (AGENTS.md "Workflow" says whether that needs
  approval), or say what the stray files are. A rebase over uncommitted changes is how work
  gets lost.
- **Feature ship with unticked lines in the umbrella checklist** → STOP and say which
  sub-issues are still open; the feature PR is for a finished feature.

## 2. Bring the branch up to date with its base

A task branch REBASES onto its base:

    git fetch origin --prune
    git rebase origin/$BASE

The base moves under open PRs; a stale base can silently reverse a recent merge in the
squash.

A feature branch (feature ship) MERGES the trunk in — never a rebase, the open sub-PRs
hang off its commits (AGENTS.md "Feature branches"):

    git fetch origin --prune
    git merge origin/$DEFAULT

On conflict: resolve honestly, per the file. **A lockfile is never resolved by hand** —
resolve the manifest (`package.json` or equivalent), then re-run the package manager's
install and let it rebuild the lockfile from the conflicted state. Never resolve a conflict
by taking one side wholesale without reading what the other side changed.

## 3. Run the full local gate

Run it exactly as AGENTS.md "Getting to master" defines it — that section is the source of
truth and wins on drift. If AGENTS.md names no gate, fall back to the scripts that exist in
`package.json` (typically `type-check`, `lint`, `test`) and say in the PR body which you ran.

**Red is a stop, not a hurdle.** Fix the code. Never delete, `.skip`, weaken or mock away a
test to get green — the human doesn't read diffs, so CI green is this project's only machine
guarantee. Formatting is fixed by running the formatter, never by hand. A dead-code or lint
hit is fixed, not silenced; a genuine false positive goes into the tool's config file WITH a
comment saying why.

**One more check when `BASE` is a feature branch:** a schema-surface change never rides
a feature branch (AGENTS.md "Specs and plans") — it ships to the trunk as its own PR.
List the files this branch changes (`git diff --name-only origin/$BASE...HEAD`) and read
them against the repo's declaration of its schema surface (`scripts/schema-lock.config.mts`
where the schema-lock check is installed; AGENTS.md "Shared mutable state" otherwise).
Any match → STOP: say which files, and that they belong in a separate trunk-bound PR,
additive and backward-compatible, with this branch rebased onto the trunk after it
merges. There is no override; the human cannot keep one dev database valid for two
schemas.

## 4. Push

    git push -u origin <branch>

The repo's `.githooks/pre-push` hook runs the static gate and blocks direct pushes
to the default branch locally; the server-side branch ruleset, where configured,
refuses them too. It must run: `--no-verify`, `SKIP_PUSH_GATE` and
`ALLOW_DIRECT_PUSH` are the human's overrides and are forbidden to you (AGENTS.md "Getting to
master").

## 5. Open the PR

    gh pr create --base "$BASE" --title "<conventional commit title>" --body "..."

If a PR already exists for this branch, step 4's push updated it — don't open a second one.

**Title:** a conventional commit (`feat(feed): …`, `fix: …`, `chore(agents): …`). It becomes
the squash-commit title on the base branch, and the `PR hygiene` check fails a
non-conventional one. A feature ship's title names the feature (`feat(i18n): …`) — it is
the one commit the trunk will keep of it.

**Body:** follow `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Two sections are the ones that matter,
and you must WRITE them, not fill them:

- **The issue link** — `Closes #N` (auto-closes the issue and cross-links this PR into its
  timeline on squash-merge; that cross-link IS the history — into a feature branch the
  committed `feature-merge.yml` workflow does the closing), `Refs #N` for an umbrella issue
  that stays open across several PRs, or `No issue` only when there genuinely isn't one.
  A feature ship writes `Closes #<umbrella>` and, under "What & why", the list of sub-PRs
  that make it up (`gh pr list --state merged --base <feature-branch>`): that list is
  what the integration reviewer checks the diff against.
- **`## Docs`** — every doc this diff makes stale, one `* <file> — <what changed>` bullet
  each, or `Docs: none — <real reason>`. Doc drift is a bug: if the diff changes behavior
  described in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` or any `docs/*` page, this PR updates it. Anything
  the HUMAN runs or must remember (script, page, env var, ritual) means `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
  is one of those bullets.

The `PR hygiene` check tests these two for PRESENCE; the reviewer tests them for TRUTH. So
boilerplate here doesn't pass — it just hollows out the gate and gets blocked one step later.
Stop and answer both questions for real.

Also fill, honestly:

- **How to test by hand** — the ONLY section the human reads before testing. Concrete
  click-through steps: where to go, what to click, what must happen. For a feature ship:
  the whole feature, end to end, on the feature branch — the human tries it there
  BEFORE merging (AGENTS.md "Feature branches").
- **Risk nearby** — what this could regress, and any test change declared explicitly. A
  deleted/skipped/weakened test with no justification here is a reviewer blocker.
- If the diff touches anything AGENTS.md flags as one-branch-at-a-time (a schema, a
  generated artifact): say so, spell out what applying it does to the shared environment,
  and confirm the generated artifact is committed in this same PR.
- If test-first didn't apply (docs, config, pure deletion, indexes, logging), say that
  outright instead of implying tests exist.

## 6. Hand off

**Auto-review hook first:** if the repo carries an executable `.agents/auto-review.sh`,
launch it now with the PR number — whether step 5 created the PR or step 4's push updated
an existing one (a fix push supersedes the previous verdict, so it gets a fresh review
too):

    .agents/auto-review.sh <pr-number>

The script detaches itself and returns immediately. HOW the reviewer runs — a background
process, a terminal session, something else — is the script's own business, decided when
it was rendered at adoption; this skill only starts it. Run it as its OWN command,
nothing chained before or after: a diagnostic appended to the launch (`…; sleep 2; cat …`)
both violates "never read its output" and turns the exact command the repo's
`.claude/settings.json` allows into a compound one a permission layer may refuse.

Say you launched it, and that the PR's `auto-review` status will track it (pending while
the reviewer runs, then green when the verdict comment lands, red if it dies). Never wait
for it and never read its output — its deliverable is a verdict comment on the PR, not
anything in your transcript. If the script is absent or not
executable, skip silently: this repo runs its reviews by hand. But if the launch itself is
DENIED by your harness's permission layer, do not skip silently — say so plainly: the
allow rule for exactly this command ships in `.claude/settings.json`, so a denial means
that setting is missing or overridden, and a review the human assumes started never did.

Print the PR URL, and state plainly: what still needs doing (anything the human owes —
env vars, dashboard clicks, one-off SQL), and that a substantive PR gets an independent
`review` pass from a FRESH session — ideally a different model family, which is the one
hard rule in AGENTS.md "Model routing" — before the human merges. If you launched the
auto-review hook, that fresh session is already running and its verdict lands as a PR
comment. A feature ship gets the `review` skill's INTEGRATION form — the pieces were
reviewed on the way in — and the human merges it only after trying the feature branch
by hand; say both. You never merge, and green CI is not permission to merge.
