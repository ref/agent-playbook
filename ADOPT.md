# ADOPT.md — how an agent installs this workflow

You are an agent, installing the agent-playbook workflow into the repository you are
currently in. Fetch the templates with a shallow clone into a temporary directory (delete
it when done):

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ref/agent-playbook <tmpdir>

If the current directory is not a git repository, stop and say so.

This page gives you GOALS and BOUNDARIES, not a script. Handle the unforeseen with
judgment — an odd toolchain, a file that doesn't fit the table, a CLI whose flags moved —
and say what you found and what you chose. Where a choice is genuinely the human's (it
costs money, deletes something, or changes their habits), ask. Report what you detected
before writing anything.

## Rule 0 — existing files are the human's, not yours

Outranks everything below. **Never overwrite an existing file or setting without showing
the exact diff and getting a yes** — one file at a time. A destination that does not exist
yet you may write freely. Two standing cases: an existing `.claude/settings.json` is
MERGED, never replaced (the template owns only the `attribution` keys, the
`Bash(.agents/auto-review.sh:*)` allow rule — without that rule, restricted permission
modes silently block the reviewer launch — and the task-status `hooks` entries; a
repo's own hooks beside those entries are untouched); and an occupied `core.hooksPath` (husky,
lefthook) is never re-pointed — offer chaining (`sh .githooks/pre-push "$@" < /dev/stdin`)
or moving the hook into their directory, and say plainly that until resolved nothing
blocks a direct push.

## What to install

| Template                     | Destination                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENTS.md`                  | `AGENTS.md`                                          |
| `RUNBOOK.md`                 | `docs/RUNBOOK.md`                                    |
| `pull_request_template.md`   | `.github/pull_request_template.md`                   |
| `workflows/*.yml` (4 files)  | `.github/workflows/`                                 |
| `dependabot.yml`             | `.github/dependabot.yml`                             |
| `githooks/pre-push`          | `.githooks/pre-push` (chmod 755)                     |
| `settings.json`              | `.claude/settings.json` (merge into existing)        |
| `skills/*/` (5 skills)       | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`                     |
| `scripts/auto-review.sh`     | `.agents/auto-review.sh` (755; only with a reviewer) |
| `scripts/task-status/*` (4)  | `.agents/` (755 on the `.sh`; installed by default)  |
| `scripts/worktree/*` (9)     | `scripts/` (only when the worktree module is wanted) |
| `scripts/schema-lock/*` (4)  | `scripts/` (only when the schema-lock check is wanted) |
| `tooling/*` (3)              | repo root (only the ones "The static gate" installs)  |
| `rust/*` (6 fragments)       | spliced into the files above — only where a Cargo.toml exists ("Rust"); never installed as files |

Plus five RELATIVE symlinks: `.claude/skills/<name>` → `../../.agents/skills/<name>`.
`.agents/` is the vendor-neutral home — Codex/ChatGPT and Antigravity/Gemini read it
directly, Claude Code follows the symlink. Never create per-vendor copies (`.gemini/`,
`.codex/`); copies drift. If `.claude/skills/<name>` already exists as a real directory,
that is Rule 0 territory: ask, never delete it to make room.

If the repo has no `CLAUDE.md`, offer one containing only `@AGENTS.md` (same offer for
another tool's wrapper file, e.g. `GEMINI.md`).

**Write the sync lock** — `.agents/playbook.lock`, recording the playbook commit this
adoption installed (`git -C <tmpdir> rev-parse HEAD`) so the `playbook-update` skill can
scope later syncs to what actually moved:

    # agent-playbook sync state — machine-written by the playbook-update and
    # playbook-compact skills; do not edit by hand.
    commit <sha>
    synced <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Placeholders.** Few files are rendered. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md` and `ci.yml`
carry `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` / `{{PKG_MANAGER}}` / `{{INSTALL_CMD}}` / `{{TEST_CMD}}` plus
ci.yml's two whole-line block placeholders; `auto-review.sh` carries `{{REVIEW_CMD}}`;
where the schema-lock check is installed, its config carries `{{SCHEMA_SURFACE}}` (see
that step). The Rust placeholders — `{{RUST_JOB_BLOCK}}` (ci.yml),
`{{RUST_JOB_TWIN_BLOCK}}` (ci-docs.yml), `{{RUST_AUDIT_JOB_BLOCK}}` (security.yml),
`{{RUST_RUNBOOK_BLOCK}}` (RUNBOOK) and the inline `{{RUST_GATE}}` in both gate lines —
render to the `templates/rust/` fragments where a Cargo.toml was detected and to
NOTHING otherwise: a whole-line placeholder is deleted with its line, the inline one
with no trace, so a repo without Rust renders exactly as it did before the placeholders
existed ("Rust" below). Everything else (the hook, the worktree scripts) detects its
facts at runtime and is installed byte-for-byte. No `{{...}}` token may survive in
anything you write.

## Detect and render

- **Default branch**: `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`,
  falling back to the local HEAD's name.
- **Package manager**: from the lockfile — `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm /
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; `yarn.lock`, `bun.lock(b)`, `package-lock.json`
  accordingly; none → npm, and offer to commit a lockfile (CI caching and the cooldown
  policy both want one).
- **Test command**: the `test` script if it exists; a runner in devDependencies with no
  script → propose the direct command and ask; no tests at all → drop the CI test step,
  mark the gate line in `AGENTS.md`/`RUNBOOK.md` as aspirational, and say so plainly.
  Never invent a fake passing command.
- **ci.yml**: keep only the steps whose `package.json` scripts exist (`format:check`,
  `type-check`, `lint`, `knip`, `build`, tests) — a step calling a missing script is a hard CI
  failure on the human's first run. Delete, don't soften with `--if-present`: a tolerant
  step is green while checking nothing. Update the job `name:` to list the surviving
  steps and mirror it byte-for-byte into `ci-docs.yml`, whose `paths:` must stay the
  exact inverse of ci.yml's `paths-ignore:` (the no-op twin reports the required check on
  doc-only PRs). Apply the same deletions to the gate line in `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/RUNBOOK.md`. `.nvmrc`: create one from the local `node -v` major if absent —
  ci.yml reads it.
- **Missing gate tools**: see "The static gate" below — that step installs them, and
  ci.yml's steps follow from what it lands.
- **Rust**: a `Cargo.toml` anywhere outside `node_modules/` and `target/`
  (`git ls-files '*Cargo.toml' ':!node_modules/**'` — tracked files only, so a vendored
  crate in a build directory does not count). Record its directory as
  `{{CARGO_DIR}}`, in the `/`-rooted form Dependabot wants: `/` for a crate at the
  repo root, `/src-tauri` for a Tauri app. Several Cargo.toml files (a workspace) → the
  workspace root's directory. No `package.json` beside it → out of scope, say so: the
  hook and CI read their scripts from `package.json`, and that contract stays. Rust
  changes what "Rust" below renders and nothing else — no file is skipped or added for
  it, and a repo without a Cargo.toml renders byte-for-byte as before.
- **Tauri**: a `tauri` dependency in that Cargo.toml (`[dependencies]` — a
  `tauri-build` in `[build-dependencies]` alone does not count). It affects ONE thing:
  which system packages the Rust CI job installs on Linux (the `{{TAURI_DEPS_STEP}}`
  fragment). There is no "Tauri edition" of anything else.
- **Build-time env**: don't reason about it — RUN the build with every `.env.example`
  variable set to empty (`DATABASE_URL= … run build`; explicitly-empty values survive
  framework env loaders, reproducing a runner with no `.env`). A failure naming a
  variable puts an obviously-fake dummy into `{{BUILD_ENV_BLOCK}}` (step-level, so tests
  cannot inherit it); a green build → delete the placeholder line. Do this before the
  human's first PR — a red first run reads as "the setup is broken".
- **Database in tests**: on evidence (a compose file, `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.example`, a
  driver dependency), report it and ask; yes → a service container with a health check in
  `{{DB_SERVICE_BLOCK}}` plus a job-level `DATABASE_URL`, which the Build step then
  inherits.

## The static gate (install what is missing — this is the guarantee)

The human does not read diffs. Every promise this workflow makes about quality is
carried by the gate, so a repo whose gate is `tsc --noEmit` alone is running on a third
of it: type-check sees no floating promise, no `any` spreading through three files, no
unused export, no condition that is always true, and no formatting at all. Getting the
gate complete is not polish to do later — it is the reason the human can merge without
reading.

So for each of these that the repo has no script for, **offer it with its ready config
and a recommendation to take it**, one question each, and say what it costs:

| missing script | install | template | the cost, said up front |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `format:check` | `oxfmt` (the standard — see below) | `templates/tooling/.oxfmtrc.json` → repo root | one reformat-everything commit; keep it as its own commit so it never hides a real change |
| `lint` | `oxlint` + `oxlint-tsgolint` (the standard — see below) | `templates/tooling/.oxlintrc.json` → repo root | type-aware rules surface real errors in existing code on the first run; fixing them is part of this step, not a follow-up |
| `knip` | `knip` | none — it infers entry points; add `knip.json` only where it guesses wrong | usually finds dead exports and unused dependencies immediately; it is the only one of the three that sees ACROSS files, which neither tsc nor a linter does. Runs in CI only, never the pre-push hook — a mid-work branch legitimately carries a dead export for an hour |
| `format:check:rust` _(Rust repos only)_ | `rustup component add rustfmt` — a toolchain component, nothing in `package.json` | none — rustfmt's defaults are the standard; a `rustfmt.toml` only where the repo already has one | one reformat-everything commit, kept as its own commit, exactly like oxfmt's; runs in the pre-push hook, seconds |
| `lint:rust` _(Rust repos only)_ | `rustup component add clippy` | none — the default lint set with warnings denied (`-D warnings`); a `[lints.clippy]` table in Cargo.toml only where the repo already keeps one | the first run surfaces real findings in existing code, and fixing them is part of this step, not a follow-up; it COMPILES the crate, so the first hook run on a cold `target/` is minutes and every later one seconds |
| `test:rust` _(Rust repos only)_ | nothing — `cargo test` ships with cargo | none | CI only, never the hook: it compiles the crate in the test profile. A crate with no tests still gets the script — an empty run is green, and the step exists so the first test written is already gated |
| `audit:rust` _(Rust repos only)_ | `cargo install cargo-audit` locally (CI installs a prebuilt binary itself) | none — the RustSec database needs no config; an `--ignore RUSTSEC-…` WITH its reason and a removal date is the only thing a repo ever adds | red on the day an advisory names a crate already in `Cargo.lock`, on a PR that touched nothing Rust — that is the quarantine working, and the RUNBOOK says so; `cargo deny` is the heavier alternative (licenses, bans, sources) and is a repo's to choose in the script, with `taiki-e/install-action@cargo-deny` swapped into security.yml |

**The linter is ONE standard across every repo, not a per-repo taste**: `oxlint` +
`oxlint-tsgolint`, with `templates/tooling/.oxlintrc.json` and
`"lint": "oxlint --type-aware"`. Its type-aware backend (tsgolint) carries 59 of
typescript-eslint's 61 type-aware rules, and — the fact that makes one standard possible
at all — it **bundles typescript-go, so it does not use the repo's `typescript` at all**.
A repo on TypeScript 6 and a repo on TypeScript 7 get the same linter and the same rules;
the only requirement is a `tsconfig.json` without options TypeScript 7 removed. Keep
`oxlint-tsgolint` and the repo's TypeScript moving roughly together, since the backend
tracks a TypeScript release.

**The formatter is the same standard's other half**: `oxfmt`, from the same oxc
toolchain as the linter, with Prettier-compatible output as its stated target — so a
repo already formatted by Prettier converges with a near-empty diff, and its config
migrates with `oxfmt --migrate=prettier` instead of being re-decided. There is no
ignore file to render: it reads `.gitignore` (and a `.prettierignore` where one exists)
and skips lockfiles natively. The template config's `ignorePatterns` ships listing the
playbook-owned files (`.agents`, `.claude`, `.githooks`, `.github` as trees, and the
worktree module's nine files in `scripts/` BY NAME) — those files must stay
byte-identical to the playbook or every later sync reads the formatter's rewrite as
drift; skills are Markdown and settings are JSON, so oxfmt WOULD rewrite them. The
module's entries are per-file, never `scripts/**`, because this workflow installs the
module INTO `scripts/` without owning the directory: a repo's own scripts live there
too, and a blanket ignore silently removes them from `format:check` — a gate that is
green because it skipped the files (one adopted repo ran with four of its own scripts
invisible to the formatter this way). Prune entries that don't apply: a repo that
declined the worktree module deletes its nine lines. It formats JSON, CSS and Markdown
alongside JS/TS. Note it is pre-1.0 —
the trade accepted here is formatter-output churn across versions, never correctness,
because a formatter changes style and nothing else.

`knip` is unaffected by any of this (v6 parses with oxc, not TypeScript's API), and so is
the formatter — it needs no type checker.

Scripts to add — the names matter, ci.yml and `.githooks/pre-push` both look for exactly
these: `"format": "oxfmt"` (in-place write is its default mode),
`"format:check": "oxfmt --check"`, `"lint": "oxlint --type-aware"`, `"knip": "knip"`.

And where a Cargo.toml was detected, the Rust four — the JS name plus `:rust`, one rule
for all of them, and every cargo flag lives HERE and nowhere else (the hook, ci.yml and
security.yml only ever say `<pkg> run <script>`), which is what keeps those files
byte-identical across a crate at the root and a crate in `src-tauri/`:

    "format:check:rust": "cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all --check",
    "lint:rust": "cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings",
    "test:rust": "cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml",
    "audit:rust": "cargo audit --file src-tauri/Cargo.lock"

(`src-tauri/` being the detected Cargo directory; drop the `--manifest-path` /
`--file` for a crate at the root.) A repo that already runs one of these under another
name (`check:rust`, `clippy`, `cargo:test` — seen live) is offered the RENAME, never a
second script with different flags beside the first: two scripts running clippy with two
flag sets is two gates checking different things. Missing scripts are offered, never
invented — a `test:rust` on a crate with no tests is still an honest green, but a
`lint:rust` the human declined is a declined row in "Tooling decision records", exactly
as for `lint`.

Then, whatever the answers:

- **Installed** → keep that step in `ci.yml`, keep its word in the job `name:`, mirror
  the name byte-for-byte into `ci-docs.yml`, and keep it in the gate line in `AGENTS.md`
  and `docs/RUNBOOK.md`. The pre-push hook needs nothing: it runs whichever of these
  scripts exist.
- **Declined** → delete the step, delete the word from BOTH job names, drop it from both
  gate lines — and record the decline where it will be seen again: a line in `AGENTS.md`
  under "Tooling decision records", naming what is missing and why. A decline recorded
  only in your closing summary is a decision nobody can find a month later, and the
  repository looks like it never had the option (one adopted repo ran ten PRs with no linter
  and no formatter before anyone noticed). `UPDATE.md` re-raises what is missing on every
  sync — that only works if the answer is in the repo.

These config files are rendered ONCE and then belong to the repo: a sync never overwrites
them. They carry no `{{...}}` tokens, so "rendering" is copying them and then deleting
what does not apply — a Tailwind plugin in a repo with no Tailwind, an ignore entry for a
directory that does not exist.

### A repo already on something else: ASSESS it, never grandfather it

A repo that already has ESLint, or an older TypeScript, does not get to keep them because
it had them first. Nor do you migrate it because the standard says so. **You find out
whether it can move, with commands, and the human decides on what you found.** Two repos
drifting apart is two different quality guarantees, which is the same as none — and
"we'll do it later" without a named condition is how later never arrives.

Both assessments run in a SCRATCH worktree, never the main checkout, and neither fixes
anything: their whole output is a report. Bound them — install, run the gate, read the
errors. Do not start repairing the codebase to make a probe pass; that is the migration
itself, and it is not yours to start.

**Can the linter move (ESLint → oxlint)?**

1. Install `oxlint` + `oxlint-tsgolint`, drop in the config, run `oxlint --type-aware`.
2. Name the rules the repo's current ESLint config enables that oxlint has NO equivalent
   for. Read the overlap rather than guessing at it — `eslint-plugin-oxlint` exists to
   encode exactly that mapping, and oxlint ships built-in plugin sets (React, hooks,
   a11y, Next and others) whose coverage is a fact you can check, not estimate.
3. Run both linters over the current code and diff the findings. What only ESLint reports
   is the concrete loss; what only oxlint reports is the concrete gain. Counts and rule
   names, not adjectives.

**Can TypeScript move to 7?**

1. List every dependency that integrates through TypeScript's JS API — the framework's
   type layer, `ts-jest`, `ts-morph`, template checkers for Vue/Svelte/Astro. TypeScript 7
   ships without a stable programmatic API (7.1 is where it returns), so these are exactly
   what breaks.
2. In the scratch worktree: install TypeScript 7, run type-check, build and tests. Report
   what fails, verbatim, not paraphrased.
3. Where the framework supports 7 only behind an experimental flag, say the flag by name
   AND say it is experimental. A repo that auto-deploys on merge running on a preview flag
   is a decision the human makes knowingly, not a detail you fold into a summary.

**Then report and stop.** Three shapes, and say which you would pick and why: move now
(with the cost you measured), move partly (e.g. the linter now, TypeScript when its
blocker clears), or wait. Waiting is a legitimate answer — an unstable dependency is a
real reason — but it is only allowed to be an answer when it names **what would unblock
it**: a version, a release, a flag leaving preview.

Whatever the human decides goes into `AGENTS.md` under "Tooling decision records", WITH
that unblock condition. That is what turns a deferral into something a later sync can
check (`UPDATE.md` does exactly this) instead of an argument re-run from scratch every
few months, or — the actual failure — a repo quietly left behind.

`templates/tooling/eslint.config.mjs` exists for this outcome: a repo that assessed the
move and deferred it still deserves a good linter meanwhile. It requires TypeScript
< 6.1 (typescript-eslint's peer range stops there, and forcing the install past it
crashes ESLint at startup), which is itself a fact for the report — a repo on TypeScript
7 cannot defer the linter migration, because there is nothing to defer TO.

## Rust (detected — the second half of the gate, or nothing)

Everything in this section happens only where "Detect and render" found a Cargo.toml.
Where it did not, the whole section reduces to one action: delete the five whole-line
placeholders and the inline `{{RUST_GATE}}`, and the rendered files are what the
playbook rendered before Rust existed in it — that equivalence is the design, and
verification check 2 (no surviving token) plus check 9 below are what prove it held.

The pieces live in `templates/rust/`, six fragments that are SPLICED, never installed
as files. Render each with the same placeholder values as the file it lands in
(`{{PKG_MANAGER}}`, `{{INSTALL_CMD}}`), plus `{{CARGO_DIR}}`:

| fragment | goes into | replacing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci-job.yml` | `ci.yml` | the `{{RUST_JOB_BLOCK}}` line — a second job, `rust (format, clippy, test)` |
| `tauri-deps-step.yml` | `ci-job.yml` | its `{{TAURI_DEPS_STEP}}` line, ONLY where Tauri was detected; deleted otherwise |
| `ci-docs-twin.yml` | `ci-docs.yml` | the `{{RUST_JOB_TWIN_BLOCK}}` line — the no-op twin, same job name |
| `security-job.yml` | `security.yml` | the `{{RUST_AUDIT_JOB_BLOCK}}` line — `cargo audit (RustSec advisories)` |
| `dependabot-cargo.yml` | `dependabot.yml` | nothing — APPENDED under `updates:`, the same way the `docker` entry is (a declared local part, UPDATE.md) |
| `runbook-ci-shape.md` | `docs/RUNBOOK.md` | the `{{RUST_RUNBOOK_BLOCK}}` line, under "CI shape" |

And the inline `{{RUST_GATE}}` in the gate line of `AGENTS.md` and `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
renders to the Rust scripts appended in the same shape as the JS ones — `
&& <pkg> run format:check:rust && <pkg> run lint:rust && <pkg> run test:rust` (with the
leading ` && `) — listing exactly the scripts the repo ended up with, the same rule as
the JS half: a gate line promising a clippy the repo declined is the version every
future session will believe. `audit:rust` is NOT in the gate line: it needs the network
for the advisory database and answers a question about the world, not about the diff,
so it belongs to CI the way gitleaks does.

The job is rendered WHOLE, then trimmed to the scripts that exist, exactly as `checks`
is: a step calling a `test:rust` the human declined is a red first run. Update the job
`name:` to the surviving steps and mirror it byte-for-byte into the twin — the
required-check rule from "Detect and render" applies to this job name exactly as to
`checks`. `.githooks/pre-push` needs nothing: it runs `format:check:rust` and
`lint:rust` when `package.json` defines them and never mentions them otherwise, and
`test:rust` stays out of it for the reason the JS tests do, plus compile time (the hook's
own header says so).

Three facts to establish by RUNNING, not by reading, and to report as
`[verified-by-execution]`:

1. **Do clippy and the tests need the front end built first?** A Tauri crate's
   `tauri::generate_context!()` embeds the `frontendDist` directory at compile time and
   PANICS when it does not exist — unless the build is a dev build with a `devUrl`
   configured, in which case it embeds nothing and never looks. Plain `cargo clippy` /
   `cargo test` (no `custom-protocol` feature, which only `tauri build` enables) ARE dev
   builds, so a repo with a `devUrl` in `tauri.conf.json` — the common shape — needs no
   front end for the Rust job. Do not trust that paragraph: in a scratch clone with no
   `dist/`, run `<pkg> run lint:rust`. Green → delete the `{{RUST_FRONTEND_BUILD_STEP}}`
   line. A panic naming `frontendDist` → render that line as
   `      - run: <pkg> run build` (six-space indent, a step before the Rust scripts;
   the install above it is already in the job for this reason), and say in the summary
   that the Rust job carries a front-end build and why. Where the build needs env
   (`{{BUILD_ENV_BLOCK}}` in `checks`), the same fake values go on this step.
2. **The Tauri package list compiles the crate on a runner.** The fragment carries the
   Debian/Ubuntu list from Tauri's own prerequisites page (v2, read 2026-09-16), minus
   what the runner image already ships. It is a list that moves with WebKitGTK: on a
   Tauri repo, re-read that page before rendering and correct the fragment's line if the
   page changed — and report the diff upstream, the playbook wants it. On a non-Tauri
   crate with native dependencies of its own (a `-sys` crate, OpenSSL), the first CI run
   is the probe: a red `rust` job naming a missing `.h` or `.pc` is the repo's own apt
   line to add to that job, its own decision, recorded in the PR that adds it.
3. **The hook probe from "Verify the installation" (check 3) already covers the Rust
   scripts** — it exercises the lock, not the gate. Run the gate half once by hand:
   `<pkg> run format:check:rust && <pkg> run lint:rust` on the clean tree, so the first
   push does not meet clippy's first opinion of the codebase as a surprise. Fixing what
   it finds is part of the static-gate step, as for oxlint.

Two things the rest of the workflow already handles, said here so nobody looks for a
Rust special case: the reviewer runs the Rust half through the same `package.json`
delegators (`templates/agy/README.md` seeds them beside the JS gate; bare `cargo` is
unseeded on purpose), and `Cargo.lock` conflicts follow the lockfile rule in
`AGENTS.md` — resolve `Cargo.toml`, then let cargo rebuild the lock (`cargo update -w`
touches only what the manifest change requires). `SETUP.md` §2 lists the two extra
required checks and §4 the three extra actions to allowlist.

## The reviewer (auto-review)

The `ship` skill launches `.agents/auto-review.sh` after every PR it opens or updates: a
fresh session of a reviewer CLI — a DIFFERENT model family than the authoring tool, the
one hard rule — follows the `review` skill and posts the verdict comment, so the human
only reads verdicts. Detect the installed agent CLIs (`command -v` over `claude`, `codex`,
`agy`, `gemini`, and whatever the human mentions), report the list, and **ask which one
reviews** — reminding them it spends that CLI's quota on every `/ship`. No CLI installed,
or the human declines → do not install the script; reviews stay manual (`/review <n>`)
and nothing else changes.

Render `{{REVIEW_CMD}}` from the chosen CLI's OWN `--help`, never from memory. It must
reference `"$PR"`, instruct the CLI to read `.agents/skills/review/SKILL.md` and review
PR `#$PR` following it exactly, and **name the model explicitly** — a default model
drifts with releases and can silently break the cross-family rule. The script runs the
session on a visible cmux terminal, so it may be interactive.

Permissions — **enumerate what the protocol needs, plus a narrow deny**: list the tool
shapes a review actually uses (probe tests, mutation runs, the local gate, read-only
`git` and `gh`) in the CLI's permission config, and machine-deny `git push`,
`gh pr merge`, `gh pr close` in EVERY form the config distinguishes (some CLIs keep
sandboxed and unsandboxed variants as separate rules; agy did until 1.2.2 and no longer
does — `templates/agy/README.md` has the one-form rule and the migration).

**Never a wildcard allow.** "Grant broadly" is not "grant everything": a `*` rule makes
the deny list the ONLY boundary, and a prefix deny list is three command shapes — it does
not cover `gh api` (whose REST route merges a PR) or an argument-reordered
`git -C <dir> push`. one adopted repo was adopted with `command(*)`, looked configured, and had
no second layer for six PRs.

Scope the run to the REVIEWER's worktree — `<repo>-wt-review`, a sibling of the main
checkout — with whatever the CLI offers (sandbox, workspace trust, allowed directories,
per-path file grants). Not the main checkout: it holds the author's uncommitted work,
the reviewer never runs there, and granting it both misses the directory that needs
granting and hands out the one that must not be. Never reach for a blanket permission
bypass — a bypass does not widen the toolset, it dissolves the boundary. Where the CLI
has a pre-tool-use hook, install it as a second, independent deny layer for the same
three commands: not an optional extra, since a skipped question here is a repo that can
never be given the layer later (`UPDATE.md` will not back-fill a hook file the repo does
not have).

**For agy this is all written out** — the ready-made hook guard, the `{{REVIEW_CMD}}`
shape, and the allowlist seeding (one grant form since agy 1.2.2) — in `templates/agy/README.md`;
copy its shape when rendering for another CLI.

**Prove the render by RUNNING it**, and report both probes in the summary as
`[verified-by-execution]`:

1. Working probe: the rendered command against a harmless prompt or the repo's smallest
   real PR — it starts, reads the skill, runs a command, calls `gh pr list`, and never
   stalls on a question nobody can answer. One folder-trust question on the very first
   review is expected; a second prompt is a finding, not a quirk to answer by hand.
2. Deny probe: instruct the same session to run `git push --dry-run` — it must be REFUSED
   by the machine layer, not by the model's good manners.

**Re-run both probes whenever the way the reviewer is LAUNCHED changes** — a new CLI
version, different flags, a different terminal or workspace model — not only at adoption.
One adopted repo moved its reviewer from headless to a cmux workspace in a later PR, nothing
required re-proving the run, and the regression (a permission prompt per file read)
shipped and survived two syncs.

## cmux (optional, detected)

Detect: `command -v cmux && CMUX_QUIET=1 cmux ping` — an installed binary whose socket is
silent counts as absent. What cmux changes when present:

- **auto-review** runs in a visible workspace `review #<pr>` beside the human's own —
  that is the script's design. Without cmux it fails loudly per launch and the
  `auto-review` status tells the human to run `/review <pr>` themselves: an honest
  outcome, not a bug to fix with a silent background fallback. Reviews share ONE worktree
  and therefore run one at a time; a second PR's workspace opens immediately and waits,
  saying "queued behind #N" in its `auto-review` status.
- **task workspaces**: the worktree module's `task:start` opens a one-pane workspace
  running the agent when cmux answers — seeded with the caller's prompt where one was
  passed (`task:start <name> <branch> "/do 46"`), so the spawned agent starts ON the
  task instead of waiting for input; without cmux the git half still works. (It used to
  be an agent + shell split; the shell pane was dismissed by hand on every task, and
  `cmux new-split right` covers the rare case where one is wanted.)
- **every workspace gets a live status pill** — "The task-status pill" below; it
  installs regardless of cmux and simply does nothing without it.
- **verdict announcements are built in**: when the verdict comment lands, the launcher
  itself sends the desktop notification; on an approve it opens the PR page as a
  background tab in the reviewer's workspace, and on a blocker it reaches the AUTHOR's
  task workspace on three channels — the `needs-attention` sidebar lane and a checklist
  item (both survive a closed session), then `cmux send` (the live session receives "fix
  the blockers, then /ship" as an ordinary user turn and starts the fix loop unprompted).
  The author's workspace is found by its WORKTREE PATH (cwd), not by its title — titles
  get renamed; a rename must never lose a blocker — and the resolution outcome lands in
  the log and in the `auto-review` status text either way. Nothing to
  wire — behavior ships in the script, and the RUNBOOK only describes it.
- **What NOT to wire**: per-tool-call "ask" announcements. Against a properly seeded
  allowlist nothing stalls, and a notify per call blinks once per command for the entire
  review (learned live). An announcement is only sane paired with a
  NARROW allowlist where an "ask" genuinely waits on a human — wire both or neither.
  Say this out loud in the summary, because the consequence is easy to read as a broken
  integration: **a running review is silent until its verdict lands.** Nothing announces
  that a session started, is queued, or is waiting on a question — the `auto-review`
  status on the PR is where a stalled review shows up, and past an hour it says so in
  words ("no verdict after 90 min — the reviewer may be waiting on a prompt") rather than
  sitting at a bare `pending`. The first review's folder-trust prompt is still answered on
  the reviewer's own terminal.

## The task-status pill (installed by default)

The four `scripts/task-status/*` files go into `.agents/` unconditionally, and their
wiring — eight `hooks` entries — arrives through the `settings.json` merge above. No
question to ask: outside cmux every hook exits before touching anything, so where it
cannot help the whole feature costs one no-op `sh` start per event. Under cmux it puts
a `task` pill in the sidebar with five states — `Working` (with elapsed turn time past
a minute) while the agent moves, amber `Waiting for you` / `Asked you a question` when
it is blocked on the human, slate `Background work` / `Finished` at turn end. The
design rule the five states enforce: **amber means the agent literally cannot proceed
without you, never "it went quiet"** — a two-state version that mapped amber onto
`Stop` shipped first and made finished reports demand attention while open dialogs
stayed quiet (a live incident). It exists at all because cmux's own `claude_code` pill
goes blank after an answered permission prompt (measured live); both pills
stay — this one is the truthful one, cmux's carries session restore and the Feed
permission cards, and turning that integration off loses both.

Facts the wiring rests on, with their evidence class — re-verify on a Claude Code
major, never from memory:

- `PermissionRequest` and `Stop`'s `last_assistant_message` are documented hook
  surface [read-in-source, code.claude.com/docs → hooks]. The status hook returns no
  decision object: that event can allow or deny a permission, and a pill must never
  touch the permission flow.
- `background_tasks` in the `Stop` payload and the negative-lookahead `PreToolUse`
  matcher are NOT in the docs — both are [verified-by-execution, Claude Code 2.1.241,
  2026-08-24]; the live payload keys are recorded in `task-status-stop.test.ts`'s
  header.
- `PermissionDenied` is documented for AUTO-MODE denials only. A human's deny recovers
  through the next event instead — `UserPromptSubmit` when they deny with a message,
  the next tool call otherwise; re-assertion is the mechanism, not that hook.
- `task-status-stop.mjs` needs `node` on PATH. Without it the pill quietly loses only
  the prose-question state (`Finished` where it would say `Asked you a question`) —
  worth one line in the summary where the repo's runtime is not Node.

The two test files run under vitest/jest where the repo has one — after install, check
the suite count actually went UP (a glob that skips dot-directories silently leaves
them dormant; one adopted repo's root suite went 105 → 151 with them in). Where the repo has
no runner, install them anyway and say the safety net is dormant until one exists.

## The worktree module (optional — ask)

Ask: "Do you want parallel tasks in git worktrees, each started and retired in one
command?" What it buys: `task:start <name> <branch> [prompt]` cuts a fresh branch from the
latest default branch into a sibling worktree, provisions it (filtered `.env` + install),
and opens a cmux workspace where one is available — with the optional trailing prompt
handed to the agent as its first turn (`task:start fix-links fix/links "/do 46"`), so the
spawned session starts on the task instead of at an empty input; `task:finish <name>` retires it, refusing
to delete anything that could hold the only copy of work; `worktree:teardown --sweep`
reports leftovers and never deletes a branch on its own.

If yes: install the nine files into `scripts/` and wire `package.json` (Rule 0 applies
to an existing `scripts` block):

    "task:start": "node scripts/start-task.mts",
    "task:finish": "node scripts/finish-task.mts",
    "worktree:setup": "node scripts/setup-worktree.mts",
    "worktree:teardown": "node scripts/teardown-worktree.mts",
    "worktree:gc": "node scripts/gc-worktrees.mts"

The module also carries the **worktree collector** — `worktree:gc`, a ONE-SHOT
reconciliation that retires tasks nobody said goodbye to: it compares the worktrees on
disk with the workspaces open in cmux and hands every closed-but-present one to
`worktree:teardown --only-finished`, which acts only on PROOF of done (merged PR
containing the branch tip, clean tree) and refuses everything else untouched.
`task:start` runs one in its preamble, so the collection is nobody's job — there is no
long-running process anywhere in this module (its predecessor, a `task:reaper` daemon
the human had to keep alive, was retired 2026-08-14 for exactly that reason). The gc's
deletions are covered by the module's own predicate, not by an agent's judgement — that
is what keeps it inside the AGENTS.md rule about deleting working copies.

Where cmux is present, also install `templates/cmux/cmux.json` as `.cmux/cmux.json` at
the repo root (rendering `{{PKG_MANAGER}}`) and commit it: it puts a **Finish task**
entry into cmux's command palette for every workspace whose cwd is in this repo — the
palette form of `task:finish -- --here`, which retires the current task from inside its
own workspace. cmux asks a one-time trust question on the action's first run; that is
its model for project-local actions, tell the human to expect it.

**If no — and the reviewer IS installed — say so in `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, in the same
breath.** `auto-review.sh` delegates every force-removal to this module and refuses to
`rm -rf` a directory it cannot judge, so without it the reviewer's leftovers are the
human's job: the launcher reports them (a desktop notification where cmux is present) and
stops there. A decline that leaves no line in the RUNBOOK is how two full checkouts sat
unnoticed in an adopted repo. The line to write, adjusted to the repo's paths:
`git worktree remove --force <repo>-wt-review` when the reviewer's checkout is in the
way, and `git worktree prune` after.

Then ask which `.env` variables the local gate actually reads — the answer fills
`ALLOWED_ENV_VARS` in `scripts/worktree-utils.mts`. It ships EMPTY; every key added is a
declaration that every worktree, a reviewer's included, may see that value. Never offer
secrets; "none" is a common and correct answer. Ask in the same breath: **does any
variable have to be PRESENT but not REAL?** A module that throws at import time when its
secret is missing fails the gate in files that only import it, far from the cause — one
adopted repo lost 11 test files to exactly that. The answer for such a key is a
throwaway value generated into the worktree's env file, never the real one on the
allowlist. The module's three test files run under
vitest/jest where the repo has one; where it has neither, install them anyway and say the
safety net is dormant until a runner exists.

The vendored `scripts/` files — this module and schema-lock alike — are written to
compile under the strictest common TypeScript (`strict` plus
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`); a repo where they fail to type-check is a playbook bug to
report upstream, never a reason to patch the copy. A repo's STYLISTIC lint rules
(typescript-eslint's `stylisticTypeChecked` and kin: `consistent-type-definitions`,
`prefer-nullish-coalescing`, …) are a different matter: scope them OFF for the vendored
files, per file and never `scripts/**`, exactly as `.oxfmtrc.json` already scopes the
formatter. Editing the files to a repo's taste is drift that every sync re-reports
forever.

## The schema-lock check (optional — ask only where it applies)

Offer this ONLY where AGENTS.md's "Shared mutable state" section survives adoption — a
repo with no shared database or other single-writer resource has nothing for it to
guard, and a check that can never fire is dead weight. It installs independently of the
worktree module, deliberately: two open PRs collide on a schema surface with no worktree
in sight, and a worktree-using repo without a database never needs it. Where the section
survives, ask: "Do you want the one-schema-branch-at-a-time rule machine-enforced?"
What it buys: the rule stops being a habit ("check open PRs yourself") the moment work
goes parallel — which is exactly when the habit fails. Two branches on the schema
surface are not a merge conflict: a merge conflict is loud, local and undoable, while
two migration numbers cut from the same base can only be reconciled by hand, forward.

If yes: install the four files into `scripts/` and wire `package.json` (Rule 0 applies):

    "check:schema-lock": "node scripts/check-schema-lock.mts"

Then, WITH the human, replace the `{{SCHEMA_SURFACE}}` placeholder in
`scripts/schema-lock.config.mts` — the module's one per-repo fact, a predicate naming
which paths are the shared schema surface; the file carries a worked example. It ships
THROWING, so an unfilled config fails the check loudly rather than answering green while
watching nothing. The surface is the import CLOSURE the ORM actually reads, not the one
path its config names: follow the entry point's imports and re-exports to every file the
schema lives in before writing the predicate. `export * from "./auth-schema"` is the
case to look for — it makes a two-file surface look like one, and a predicate matching
only the entry point waves the sibling through (found live: one adopted repo's `auth-schema.ts`
changed the schema and generated a migration while the lock answered "changes no schema
file"). The config is the repo's own from that moment (UPDATE.md lists it as a
declared local part); the other three files are Class A. Add those three to
`.oxfmtrc.json`'s `ignorePatterns` by name — the template already lists them — and leave
the config OUT: it is repo-owned code the formatter should see. The test file runs under
vitest/jest where the repo has one; where it has neither, install it anyway and say the
safety net is dormant until a runner exists.

Wire the prose in the same breath:

- `AGENTS.md` "Shared mutable state" keeps the template's MACHINE-ENFORCED bullet
  (delete it where the check is declined — a rule that claims a check it does not have
  is the version every future session will believe).
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` "Database" keeps the template's override line
  (`ALLOW_SCHEMA_CONFLICT=1` — the human's call, like `ALLOW_DIRECT_PUSH`); delete it
  where the check is declined, for the same reason.

How it decides, so the offer is honest: two sources, both needed — `gh pr list` sees
branches that reached a PR, `git worktree list` sees the ones that have not (a worktree
started five minutes ago is exactly the window the check exists for). FAIL-CLOSED: a
source it cannot query goes red as "did not run", never green as "found nothing". Cheap
by construction: a branch touching no schema file answers green before consulting
anything and never invokes `gh` — ~90% of branches, no network dependency added to
their gate.

## Arm the hook, offer the settings

- `core.hooksPath` unset and no live hooks in `.git/hooks` →
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, and offer
  `"prepare": "git config core.hooksPath .githooks"` in `package.json` — the setting is
  per-clone and never committed, so every fresh clone starts disarmed. Occupied → Rule 0.
- Offer squash-only merges:
  `gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo} -F allow_squash_merge=true
  -F allow_merge_commit=false -F allow_rebase_merge=false -F delete_branch_on_merge=true`.
- A `Dockerfile` in the repo → offer a `docker` entry in `.github/dependabot.yml`:

      - package-ecosystem: docker
        directory: /
        schedule:
          interval: weekly
          day: monday
        cooldown:
          semver-major-days: 14
          semver-minor-days: 3
          semver-patch-days: 3
        labels:
          - dependencies
          - docker

  A repo that builds its own image owns a base image nobody else watches — the same
  silent-staleness failure the cooldowns above exist for, one registry over. The template
  deliberately ships without this entry (most adopted repos build no image), so it is a
  per-repo addition that a sync PRESERVES — UPDATE.md lists it among `dependabot.yml`'s
  declared local parts.
- Offer the package-manager cooldown — for pnpm, `minimumReleaseAge: 4320` in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (pnpm 10.16+; older pnpm or a manager with no equivalent → say
  so and drop that RUNBOOK row). Name the cost IN the offer, so the repo accepts it
  knowingly: pnpm verifies LOCKFILE ENTRIES, not just fresh resolution, so even a
  `--frozen-lockfile` CI install fails while any entry is younger than the cutoff — and
  the whole dependency TREE counts, because a bump drags in transitives whose age nobody
  chose (verified live in an adopted repo: `ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION` on a
  one-day-old transitive, on a frozen install). The honest remedies are waiting the
  window out, or a `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entry carrying its reason and a removal
  date. NEVER `trustLockfile: true`: its name reads like the fix for exactly this
  failure, and what it actually does is skip pnpm's supply-chain verification pass —
  the very protection the cooldown exists to add (pnpm's own docs say keep it off).
  A red CI on a too-fresh package is the quarantine working, not breaking.

Then point the human at **`SETUP.md`** — the GitHub side (merge settings, the branch
ruleset, Advanced Security, Actions hardening), ~10 minutes, and the ruleset step needs
one CI run to have happened first. Don't restate its contents.

## Verify the installation (re-run any time as a health check)

One line per check — `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `SKIP <reason>` — printed verbatim, never
summarized to "all good". A SKIP is not a pass.

1. The five skills are regular files under `.agents/skills/`, AND each
   `.claude/skills/<name>` is a symlink that resolves. A real directory there = FAIL (a
   second copy drifts). `.agents/playbook.lock` exists and its `commit` line matches the
   cloned playbook's HEAD.
2. `grep -rnE '\{\{[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*\}\}'` over everything installed — any hit = FAIL.
3. The hook is armed (`core.hooksPath` = `.githooks`, or the documented chain) and
   actually blocks, tested the way git runs it — exit 0 = FAIL, the lock permits:

       printf 'refs/heads/probe %s refs/heads/<default-branch> %s\n' \
         1111111111111111111111111111111111111111 \
         0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
         | SKIP_PUSH_GATE=1 sh .githooks/pre-push origin no-such-remote

4. ci.yml's steps match `package.json`'s gate scripts in BOTH directions, ci-docs.yml's
   job `name:` is byte-identical to ci.yml's, and the gate line in `AGENTS.md` and
   `docs/RUNBOOK.md` lists exactly those scripts — a gate line promising a linter the
   repo does not have is the version every future session will believe. Where ci.yml
   carries the Rust job, the same three-way match holds for it: its steps against the
   `*:rust` scripts, its `name:` against the twin's, and the gate lines' Rust tail.
5. Merge settings via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}`: squash on, merge/rebase off,
   delete-branch-on-merge on.
6. Auto-review, where installed: executable, no placeholder, and the CLI its rendered
   command launches resolves in PATH.
7. Worktree module, where installed: the four `package.json` scripts exist, and
   `node scripts/setup-worktree.mts` from the MAIN checkout refuses with exit 1 — a
   refusal that names the right directory proves the script runs, with zero side effects.
8. Schema-lock check, where installed: the `check:schema-lock` script exists, and running
   it from a clean default-branch checkout answers green with "changes no schema file" —
   proving the script runs, with zero side effects and no `gh` needed. (An unfilled
   `{{SCHEMA_SURFACE}}` is already a FAIL under check 2.)
9. Rust, both ways. No Cargo.toml in the tree →
   `grep -ilwE 'rust|cargo|clippy' AGENTS.md docs/RUNBOOK.md .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/ci-docs.yml .github/workflows/security.yml .github/dependabot.yml`
   prints nothing (`-w`, because `trustLockfile` in the RUNBOOK is not Rust; the hook
   is exempt: it names the scripts by design and is byte-identical everywhere). A hit =
   FAIL — a Rust fragment was rendered into a repo that has no Rust. A Cargo.toml in the
   tree → the four `*:rust` scripts exist in
   `package.json` or their absence is recorded in "Tooling decision records";
   `security.yml` carries the `cargo-audit` job; `dependabot.yml` carries a `cargo`
   entry whose `directory` is the Cargo directory; and `<pkg> run lint:rust` answers
   green on the clean tree (the hook will run it on the first push either way — better
   to learn here).

## Summarize and offer the first commit

Print: what was written vs what existed and how each conflict was resolved; the detected
values (branch, package manager, test command, database yes/no, Rust yes/no — with the
Cargo directory, Tauri yes/no and whether the Rust job builds the front end first —
reviewer CLI or "reviews stay manual", worktree module and its env allowlist); the
clean-env build result as something you RAN; both reviewer probes; what was declined
(recorded as accepted); and anything left aspirational. Then offer to commit —
conventional title, no AI-attribution trailers:

    chore(agents): adopt agent-playbook

Do not push. The human decides that.
