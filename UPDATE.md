# UPDATE.md — how an agent re-syncs an adopted repository

You are an agent, syncing a repository that already carries this workflow against the
current playbook. The human says: *"Read UPDATE.md from github.com/ref/agent-playbook
and sync this repository."* — or, in a repo that already carries the `playbook-update`
skill, just `/playbook-update`: that skill is the executable form of this page plus the
lock mechanics below; this page stays canonical, and on drift it wins and the skill file
is the bug. If the repo carries none of the files below, it is not adopted — that is
`ADOPT.md`'s job; stop and say so.

Fetch fresh, never a stale copy or a partial download of single files:

    git clone https://github.com/ref/agent-playbook <tmpdir>

(`--depth 1` only when the repo has no lock — see below; the delta needs history, and
the repo is small.)

## The lock — incremental syncs

`.agents/playbook.lock` records the playbook commit this repo was last synced to
(`commit <sha>` / `synced <date>`, machine-written). Read it first:

- **Lock commit == the playbook's current HEAD** → report "up to date", give the
  doc-size report below, write nothing, stop. This fast path is the lock's whole point.
- **Behind** → `git log --oneline --name-only <lock>..origin/master` in the clone is
  the delta: report it FIRST — what moved and why, from the commit messages. Then run
  the full sync below. **The lock scopes the report of what is NEW upstream; it never
  replaces the Class A byte-compare** — a lock proves which playbook was last applied,
  not that the repo's files still match it; local drift is invisible to it.
- **No lock** → adopted before locks existed. Not an error: full pass, and the sync PR
  writes the lock.

Every sync PR rewrites the lock's `commit` and `synced` lines to the playbook HEAD it
synced to, preserving any `docs` baseline lines (they belong to `/playbook-compact`).
The lock is wholly the repo's state — never byte-compared against anything.

**The doc-size report, every sync (fast path included):** `wc -w` over the auto-loaded
memory files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, anything they `@`-include) and
`docs/RUNBOOK.md`; where the lock carries `docs` baselines, report growth since the
last compaction, and suggest `/playbook-compact` where growth is noticeable. A signal
to the human, never a gate — no number here blocks a sync.

## Two classes of file

**Class B — a sync never touches these on its own authority**: `AGENTS.md`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`. They are rendered once at adoption and
then GROW with the repo — divergence there is the design working, not drift. If the
playbook's template contains an improvement this repo would genuinely want, NAME it to
the human and stop; never apply it, never fold it into the sync PR. Two edits — and only
two — may reach a Class B file from a sync, both defined below and both gated on the
human's explicit yes: correcting prose that describes the installed machinery falsely,
and the wiring ADOPT.md's static-gate step performs when its offer is accepted.

One kind of divergence is not the design working and gets REPAIRED, not just named:
where a Class B file DESCRIBES machinery falsely. Read the repo's reviewer-protocol and
gate prose against the `auto-review.sh`, skills and hooks as they stand AFTER this sync —
not only against what this sync touched, because stale prose usually outlives the change
that stranded it by several syncs. A repo whose `AGENTS.md` promises a headless
background reviewer, or a per-PR checkout, after the script stopped working that way is
telling every future session something false. A file is declared CORRECT by the same
standard it is declared false — its lines, read fact-by-fact against the machinery, with
citations ("Verification discipline" below); "describes it correctly" without line
numbers is the file being skipped, not checked. Put the exact replacement sentences in
the report; with the human's yes, apply them in the sync PR, listed per file in the PR
body.
That consent covers CORRECTIONS only — prose contradicting the installed machinery —
never the improvements of the paragraph above, which stay report-only. (This used to be
report-only too, with the sentences left for the human to type in: one adopted repo carried
the same three stale paragraphs across two syncs, because "the human's file to edit"
reliably means nobody edits it — the sync writes the sentences anyway, so the human's
part is the yes, not the typing.)

The corollary binds the PLAYBOOK, not the sync: a synced feature must WORK with an
untouched RUNBOOK. Behavior ships in Class A code; RUNBOOK only describes it to the
human. A feature whose on-switch lives in a Class B file arrives disabled in every
adopted repo — that is a playbook bug, not a repo's configuration task.

**Class A — kept identical to the playbook**: everything else adoption installed — the
five skills (`do`, `ship`, `review`, `playbook-update`, `playbook-compact`),
`pr-hygiene.yml`, `security.yml`, `ci-docs.yml`, the PR template,
`dependabot.yml`, `.githooks/pre-push`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.agents/auto-review.sh`,
the worktree module (`scripts/*.mts` + their tests), the schema-lock module
(`scripts/schema-lock.mts`, `scripts/check-schema-lock.mts`, `scripts/schema-lock.test.ts`
— its config file is wholly local, below) and the task-status module
(`.agents/task-status.sh`, `.agents/task-status-stop.mjs` + their two tests).
Compare byte-for-byte; a
difference is drift to sync — EXCEPT these declared local parts, which always survive:

- `auto-review.sh` — the rendered `REVIEW_CMD` line (this repo's reviewer command). The
  LOCAL part is WHICH CLI; the line's SHAPE is the playbook's, and a sync repairs it — and
  so is the MODEL where the CLI is agy: `templates/agy/README.md` records the current
  pick with the measurement behind it, and a sync is how a re-measured pick reaches every
  repo (it is a `--model` value, reverted in one edit; the verdict comment names the
  model, so the history stays auditable either way). Check it against the reviewer's
  page (`templates/agy/README.md` for agy, the equivalent section of `ADOPT.md` for
  anything else) and fix, in the sync PR, any of:

  - the prompt is inline instead of `"$REVIEW_PROMPT"` (the script exports it and it pins
    the worktree path);
  - the reviewer's own directory is not named as an allowed one (`--add-dir "$PWD"` for
    agy) — without it every read inside the review worktree asks;
  - the model is implicit — a default that flips to the author's family silently breaks
    cross-family review — or, with agy, is not the pick `templates/agy/README.md`
    currently names: set it, and say in the PR body which model the repo reviewed with
    until now;
  - the run is opened with a blanket permission bypass instead of the CLI's scoping flag.

  Anything else about the line — the CLI, the model name under a CLI other than agy,
  extra local flags — is the repo's and survives untouched. This paragraph used to say
  the flags survive too, and that is exactly how a fix could not travel: `--add-dir` was
  added to the reviewer's page the same day an adopted repo synced, its sync PR rewrote
  the prompt inside that very line, and the rule forbade touching the flags beside it.
  A repaired shape is reported in the PR body like any other change.
- `security.yml` — the header line recording this repo's one-time secret-sweep date.
  Where no date is recorded, the sweep has not happened — or was never written down,
  which reads the same a year later: OFFER to run it now (gitleaks over the full
  history, in the sync's own worktree) and record the date in the same PR. Report what
  the sweep finds VERBATIM before recording anything; never invent a date, and if the
  human says they swept by hand, the date is theirs to supply. And its
  `{{RUST_AUDIT_JOB_BLOCK}}` line, which the repo carries as either NOTHING (no
  Cargo.toml) or the rendered `templates/rust/security-job.yml` (with `{{PKG_MANAGER}}`
  filled in) — compare the rest of the file byte-for-byte and the job against the
  fragment the same way `REVIEW_CMD`'s shape is checked: present where the tree holds a
  Cargo.toml, absent where it does not, and never a third shape. The same rule covers
  `ci-docs.yml`'s `{{RUST_JOB_TWIN_BLOCK}}` line below.
- `dependabot.yml` — a `docker` ecosystem entry, where the repo added one for its own
  `Dockerfile` (ADOPT.md's snippet); the template ships without it on purpose. The check
  runs BOTH ways, every sync: a tree that holds a `Dockerfile` while `dependabot.yml`
  has no `docker` entry gets the OFFER — a repo that grew its Dockerfile after adoption
  is otherwise never asked, and its base image stays unwatched forever (how one adopted repo's
  build image went stale in silence). The `cargo` entry (`templates/rust/dependabot-cargo.yml`)
  is the same kind of local part with the same both-ways check: a tree holding a
  Cargo.toml while `dependabot.yml` has no `cargo` entry gets the OFFER — and that is
  one symptom of a larger one, a repo that grew a Cargo.toml AFTER adoption, for which
  the offer is ADOPT.md's whole "Rust" section (the CI job and its twin, the audit job,
  the scripts, the gate lines), reported under "static-gate gaps" below.
- `settings.json` — everything except the template's own content: the `attribution`
  keys, the auto-review allow rule, and the task-status `hooks` entries; the file was
  installed by merging, so local content is the design working. The hooks entries are
  checked by PRESENCE, never by byte comparison — a merged file can never compare
  byte-for-byte, so a missing block is invisible to the Class A diff. Every sync:
  a repo carrying `.agents/task-status.sh` whose `settings.json` lacks the template's
  hook entries — or carrying neither the script nor the entries — gets the OFFER, the
  same both-ways shape as the `docker` entry above; a repo adopted before the pill
  existed is otherwise never asked, and the module arrives disabled, the exact failure
  the Class B corollary names. A repo's own hooks beside the template's entries are
  local content and survive.
- `worktree-utils.mts` — the `ALLOWED_ENV_VARS` list; plus any per-worktree service
  provisioning this repo added to setup/teardown.
- `schema-lock.config.mts` — the WHOLE file is the repo's: it declares this repo's
  schema surface, the module's one per-repo fact. A sync never touches it — but a
  surviving `{{SCHEMA_SURFACE}}` token in it is a finding for the human: the check has
  been failing loudly since adoption, or was installed without its surface. The declared
  surface is also RE-VERIFIED every sync, the same both-ways shape as the `docker` entry
  above: follow the ORM entry point's imports and re-exports, and any file the schema is
  actually built from that no predicate matches is a finding for the human — a repo
  whose schema grew a second file after adoption is otherwise never asked, and branches
  touching that file collide unwatched (how one adopted repo's `auth-schema.ts`, re-exported
  from `schema.ts`, sat outside the lock while the CI drift check followed the re-export
  fine — the two guards disagreed and only the loud one noticed). The finding is
  reported, never written: the config stays the repo's.
- The worktree and schema-lock modules' `package.json` wiring travels WITH their files:
  a sync that brings
  a new `scripts/*.mts` whose ADOPT.md snippet names a script for it (e.g. `worktree:gc`
  → `gc-worktrees.mts`) adds that line to `package.json` in the same PR — and a sync that
  REMOVES a module file (`reaper.mts` and its `task:reaper` entry retired 2026-08-14,
  replaced by `worktree:gc`) removes its script line the same way. A script file no
  command can reach is the module arriving disabled, the exact failure the Class B
  corollary above names. The same travel rule covers `.oxfmtrc.json`'s ignore list:
  the template names the module's files one by one (never `scripts/**` — the directory
  also holds repo-owned scripts that must stay visible to `format:check`), so a sync
  that adds or removes a module file edits its ignore line in the same PR. The config
  file itself is the repo's — patterns it added beside the module's lines (its own
  docs, Markdown) are the design working, not drift; only the module-file entries are
  the playbook's to keep in step.
- `ci-docs.yml` — its job `name:` and `paths:` mirror THIS repo's `ci.yml`. Where they
  mirror it they are correct; where they don't, that is a finding for the human — the
  required check hangs on some class of PR either way. Its last line is the Rust twin
  (`templates/rust/ci-docs-twin.yml`) exactly where `ci.yml` carries the Rust job, under
  that job's exact name, and nothing where it does not: a Rust job with no twin hangs
  every doc-only PR, and a twin with no job reports a green check for nothing.
- `.agents/guard-reviewer.sh` + `.agents/hooks.json` (← `templates/agy/`) — Class A
  where the repo HAS them, with one declared insertion: a best-effort notify line the
  repo may have added to the guard's non-matching branch. Where the repo does NOT have
  them, the answer depends on WHICH CLI its `REVIEW_CMD` launches: for agy, OFFER them
  (they are the reviewer's second deny layer, and a repo that skipped the question at
  adoption is otherwise locked out of it forever — this rule used to say "never offer",
  and one adopted repo has run six reviews with the deny list as its only boundary because of
  it); for any other CLI, never — they are agy's hook format, and nothing else reads
  them.

For each file, report one of: **identical** / **differs** (what moved and why the
playbook moved it) / **missing in the repo** (OFFER it — a new gate is never installed
silently; `auto-review.sh` in particular needs ADOPT.md's reviewer detection and a human
choice) / **present only in the repo** (not yours to delete; report and leave it).

**Then report on the STATIC GATE, every sync.** Two parts, both reported before anything
is written; edits happen only on a yes:

- **Gaps.** For each of `format:check`, `lint` and `knip` that `package.json` has no
  script for — and, where the tree holds a Cargo.toml, each of `format:check:rust`,
  `lint:rust`, `test:rust` and `audit:rust` — say it is missing, say what it would catch
  that the existing scripts cannot, and offer ADOPT.md's "The static gate" step (its
  "Rust" section for the second set: a repo adopted before the playbook knew Rust, or
  one that grew a crate after adoption, carries the whole Rust half as gaps, and the
  offer is the section, not four scripts). A gap accepted once is invisible forever
  otherwise — the gate is what stands in for the human reading diffs, and a repo can run
  for months on a third of it with nothing saying so.

  **An accepted offer is executed in THIS sync**, exactly as ADOPT.md writes the step —
  install, the ready config, fixing what the new tools flag in existing code, the
  reformat as its own commit — not filed as the human's homework. That step edits
  `ci.yml`, `ci-docs.yml` and the gate lines in `AGENTS.md` / `docs/RUNBOOK.md` by
  design: the human's yes to the step IS the consent the Class B protection exists to
  secure, so "a sync never touches these" is no reason to land the tools with the gate
  half-wired — a `lint` script that ci.yml never runs is the gap again, one layer down.
- **Deferrals whose condition may have cleared.** Read `AGENTS.md`'s "Tooling decision
  records". Where one defers a move to the standard (the linter, a TypeScript major) it
  carries the condition that would unblock it — a version, a release, a flag leaving
  preview. **CHECK that condition against reality, do not re-argue the decision**: if it
  still holds, one line ("deferred at adoption pending X, X has not shipped"); if it has
  cleared, say so and offer ADOPT.md's assessment. A deferral nobody ever re-checks is
  indistinguishable from a repo left behind, and this is the only step that looks.

**Then look INSIDE the reviewer worktree's env file, every sync** — on disk
(`../<repo>-wt-review/.env*`), never only in git. `auto-review.sh` runs
`worktree:setup` only when `node_modules` is missing, so a reviewer worktree
provisioned under an older scheme keeps its old env file indefinitely — one adopted
repo's reviewer carried a full copy of the maintainer's credentials across every
review, and nothing else looks. The file may hold nothing beyond what today's
`worktree:setup` writes (the derived values plus `ALLOWED_ENV_VARS` keys); anything
more is a finding: report it verbatim by KEY NAME (never the values), and with the
human's yes delete the file and re-run `worktree:setup` in that worktree so it is
rewritten minimal. Where no reviewer worktree exists, or the worktree module is not
installed, one line says so.

## Verification discipline (binds every claim in the report)

The failure this section exists for was real: a sync declared `docs/RUNBOOK.md` correct
while its lines still described a worktree scheme two syncs dead — the file was
remembered, not read. The rules:

- **Every claim carries its evidence class**, exactly as briefs and specs do:
  `[verified-by-execution]` or `[read-in-source]`. A verdict may never rest on an
  assumption. "Identical" is a byte comparison you RAN — name the command once for the
  whole class; "correct" is lines you READ and cite.
- **Prose is checked fact-by-fact, never by impression.** First extract from the
  installed machinery — `auto-review.sh`, the skills, the hooks, the worktree scripts —
  the list of facts a Class B file could describe: how the reviewer is launched, the
  worktree scheme and its name, the trust prompt's cadence, serialization, the deny
  layers, lifecycle status, who retires the worktree, what the gate runs. Then read
  EVERY Class B file against EVERY fact, citing `file:lines` — for matches exactly as
  for contradictions. A file that says nothing about a fact is "silent on it", said so;
  silence is never rounded up to "correct".
- **Nothing inherits from the last sync.** Prior reports, open or unmerged PR text, and
  your sense of what was already fixed are not evidence: a proposed fix is not a landed
  one, and the repo is checked as it stands on its default branch. If an earlier sync's
  PR never merged, everything it proposed is still broken today.
- **The report is a fixed form.** Every section appears in every report, in order, even
  when its content is "nothing found": (1) per-file Class A verdicts, (2) the
  `REVIEW_CMD` shape check, (3) the Class B fact matrix, (4) static-gate gaps, (5)
  deferral re-checks, (6) the sweep date, (7) symlinks and `{{...}}` tokens, (8) the
  reviewer worktree env check, (9) local fixes to propose upstream, (10) the lock
  transition (old → new commit, or "no lock — written by this sync") and the doc-size
  report. An absent section is indistinguishable from an unchecked
  one — which is exactly what it usually is.
- **Last, re-read your own report as its adversary**: every verdict missing its
  evidence is a hole to go fill before showing the human anything, not a sentence to
  soften. The human merges without reading diffs; this report is the only witness.

## Apply

Show the human the per-file summary BEFORE writing anything — writing first makes the
review theatre. Then land everything agreed as ONE branch and ONE PR
(`chore: sync playbook files`), shipped by this repo's own rules — the rewritten
`.agents/playbook.lock` included. Edit the real files
under `.agents/` — never through the `.claude/skills` symlinks — and check afterwards
that the symlinks are still symlinks. No `{{...}}` token may survive in anything you
wrote. The PR body lists, per file, what changed and why the playbook changed it: the
human merges without reading diffs, and this body is their only account.

## Fixes flow playbook-first

When the diff shows the repo's copy is the BETTER one — a local fix the playbook never
got — do not overwrite it, and do not quietly keep it either: tell the human, and propose
it upstream to the playbook so it comes back down through a later sync. An improvement
that lives in exactly one repository is the failure this page exists to prevent.

**Anonymize everything that flows upstream.** The playbook is PUBLIC; the adopted repos
are not. A proposal, a commit message or a doc note never names the repository, its
domain, its issue numbers or any private detail an incident came from — "seen live in an
adopted repo" is the form.
